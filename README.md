React Popover Component
Overview
This is a simple React Popover component that demonstrates the usage of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a popover. The main feature is implemented using React state management.

Features
Popover appears when the user hovers over a button.
Popover disappears when the user moves the mouse out of the button or the popover itself.
Stylish overlay and content for the popover.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm/yarn to run and manage the React application.
Installation
1.Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/vsvankhede06/react-popover.git](https://github.com/vsvankhede06/React-Popover.git)

npm install
or
yarn

Run the development server:
npm start
or
yarn start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the React Popover in action.

How It Works
The Popover component is a functional React component that uses state to manage the visibility of the popover. When the user hovers over the button, the state is updated to show the popover, and when the user leaves the button or the popover itself, the state is updated to hide the popover.
